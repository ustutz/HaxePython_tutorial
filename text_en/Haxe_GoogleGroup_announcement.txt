New Tutorial series how to use the Haxe-Python target

Hi, I wrote the first 4 parts of a tutorial series on how to use the Haxe-Python target. 

You can find it on
https://steemit.com/@kkaos

There doesn't seem to be much information on the Python target yet, and I wanted to try out the Steemit platform.

Steemit is an experimental social media platform and uses a new cryptocurrency to reward users who upload articles, images, commentary, etc. So the posts that get upvoted receive a payout some days later, and the first people who vote receive a part of that payout.
Upvoting doesn't cost anything. The payout is created from the new units of cryptocurrency that are mined daily.

I'm still not sure if this works on the long run, but it looks like a great way to publish useful content.

So if you like the tutorial articles I would be happy if you upvote or comment them.

Cheers,
Urs
